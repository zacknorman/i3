# i3
Some nice configs for i3.

# File Locations
A simple guide

- .Xresources can be dropped right in your $HOME/
- zshrc is essentially the same, contains a screenfetch for ArchLinux, if you're not already using Zsh, you now have a good excuse to start.
-

**You'll want the 'Terminus' font**
-You can probably just find it in your repos with:

'apt-cache search terminus' or 'pacman -Ss terminus'


If you're too lazy to look through the Config file, extra dependencies are 'nitrogen', 'i3bars', 'compton', 'rofi', and 'konsole'.


I'll update this tomorrow
